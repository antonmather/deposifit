FitDeposit (DeposFit?)

Overview

Users deposit USDC into a contract to incentivise the completion of exercise goals. If the user succeeds in their goal, the funds are returned to them and provide a percentage to a charity if they wish to do so. If they fail, then the funds are donated to a charity.

The dApp also allows others to sponsor a user's fitness goals by depositing USDC and choosing how their contribution should be used. For example, a sponsor may choose to donate money to a charity that the user supports if they succeed, while donating to a charity that they don't like if they fail!

The dApp uses the FitBit API (using a Chainlink adaptor) to validate completion of the goals.
